Problem:
Given N items, w[i] is the i-th item's weight, and v[i] is the i-th item's value. 
Given a knapsack with weigth W, maximum the value within W. Items can only be used 1 or 0 times

Algorithm:
	set dp[i][j] as max value use first i items can total weight is j, therefore:
	dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-w[i]], dp[i-1]+v[i])
